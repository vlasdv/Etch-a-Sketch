# Etch-a-Sketch

Hover with your cursor on the cells to color them randomly.

It's the second JS project at The Odin Project. 
Here was the task:
1. Create divs, using JS, to make a 16x16px grid.
2. To make them appearing as a grid I needed to use flexbox.
3. On mouseover grid cells need to change color (one of additional tasks was to color them randomly)
4. There have to be a feature of changing grid size.
5. There have to be a clear button to clear the grid.

Here, again, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main difficulty was to figure out how to make a grid with divs, using flexbox. As soon as I understand what I did wrong, everything else was pretty smooth.
